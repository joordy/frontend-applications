<!-- ## :page_facing_up: Research Case

**What about the accessibility of parking garages in the major cities of the Netherlands**

#### Sub questions:

- How are the charging stations divided
- How is the parking capacity divided
- What is the maximum Drive-Through height, is it accessible for everyone?

---

## :flashlight: Concept

I'll be making a data visualization with Javascript D3 of how well developed the parking garages are in the big cities from holland. I'll be comparing the Drive-through height, EV-charging capacity and the disabled access possibilities. By using the location I display where the optimal parking garages are located. To read more about it, make sure to check out my [documentation](https://github.com/joordy/frontend-data/wiki/Concept).

## :chart: Dataset

For my project I'll be using the [Location API](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/GEO-Parkeer-Garages/t5pc-eb34) and [Specification API](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s) form the RDW.
